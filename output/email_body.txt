Subject: Leave Application

Dear Sahil,

I am writing to formally request a leave of absence for two days, from [Start Date] to [End Date].

I need this leave to [Briefly state reason - e.g., attend to a personal matter, family commitment].

I will ensure all my urgent tasks are completed before my leave. If that's not possible, I will delegate them to [Colleague's Name] who is aware and prepared to handle them.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

Sheikh Shakeel
